The fundamental concepts to understand the EUTxO (Extended Unspent Transaction Output) model of Cardano is inputs and outputs. Understanding it is key to developing on Cardano.

Let’s use a vending machine analogy to explain inputs and outputs in Cardano transactions.

# 1. **How Vending Machine works** 

## a. Outputs as Items in the Vending Machine
- Think of outputs as items (e.g., snacks or drinks) in a vending machine. Each item has:

    - A value (e.g., $1 for a soda).

    - A label (e.g., "A1" for the soda’s location).

    - A condition (e.g., you need to insert $1 to get the soda).

## b. Inputs as Money Inserted
- Inputs are like the money you insert into the vending machine. 

## c. Transaction as the Purchase Process
- A transaction is like the process of buying something from the vending machine:

    - You insert money (inputs).

    - You select the item you want (outputs).

    - The vending machine gives you the item and any change (new outputs).

# 2. How It Works in Cardano
Let’s map the vending machine analogy to Cardano transactions:

## a. Outputs (Items in the Vending Machine)
- Each output in Cardano is like an item in the vending machine:

    - Value: The amount of ADA or assets it holds.

    - Address: The condition for spending it (like the label on the vending machine).

    - Data Payload: Optional metadata (like the ingredients list on the snack).

## b. Inputs (Money Inserted)
- Inputs are references to existing outputs (items) that you want to spend. For example:

    - You reference a specific output (e.g., "I want to spend this 10 ADA output").

    - This is like picking a $10 bill from your wallet and inserting a $10 bill into the vending machine.

## c. Transaction (Purchase Process)
- A transaction is the process of:

    - Selecting which outputs (from your available bills) to spend (picking a $10 bill).

    - Creating new outputs (pick items or change).

    - Ensuring the total value of inputs equals the total value of outputs (plus fees).
